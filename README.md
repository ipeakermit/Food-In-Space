# Food-In-Space
A VR project created in Unity about testing the effects of consuming food within a simulated space-station environment. This project was initially created for the programming project 1 course by a team of 5 members.

# Dependencies
- Virtual Reality Setup
- Unity
- Windows

# Notes
The project contains multiple assets within the repo, which is responsible for the large repo size. An improvement to the project would be to seperate out the models / textures / sound effects to a seperate service or utilise git lfs to remove the bloat from the project.
